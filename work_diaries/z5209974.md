# Week 1
Group formed. Came up with some initial database schemas that we need for the custom project. Also helped write some user stories. I also researched into graphql and other technologies that the team would like to use on the backend. I also created a confluence page for all backend design docs and placed the database schemas design into it as a sub-page.

# Week 2
Created high level backend system architecture diagram to be used in the proposal. Also added more user stories. Also experiemented with PostgreSQL and created tables based on database schemas. Finally created a test python flask server to become familiar with python, flask and postgreSQL driver library.
